# WebTransport File Uploader

This repo contains a minimal working example of a file uploading app utilizing WebTransport, a new protocol for streaming over HTTP/3. Written in Go, thanks to excellent HTTP/3 and WebTransport support in these two modules:

- https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go
- https://github.com/quic-go/webtransport-go

This app was written to test WebTransport performance for transferring large files. **This application will eat your homework, and do worse. Do not use for any kind of real-life setup.**
